# Insurance-Fraud-Detection-api
###  Fraud is causing billions of $$ in loss for insurance industry. This project has attempted to develop a ML algorithm to detect. The project has used the historical transaction data including normal transactions and fraud ones to obtain normal/fraud behavior features based on machine learning techniques, and utilized these features to check if a transaction is fraud or not. A cmparative study has been conducted to decide which classifier is best for this project to train the behavior features of normal and abnormal transactions.

## Objective

> ### The traditional approach for fraud detection is based on developing heuristics around fraud indicators. Based on these heuristics, a decision on fraud would be made in one of two ways. 

> * In certain scenarios rules would be framed that would define if the case needs to be sent for investigation. 
> * In other cases, a checklist would be prepared with scores for the various indicators of fraud. An aggregation of these scores along with the value of the claim would determine if the case needs to be sent for investigation.
